# PCOS-Detection-Using-LR-and-EDA
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It can lead to complications such as infertility, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular diseases. Early detection is crucial for better management and treatment. However, traditional diagnostic methods, including hormone tests and imaging, are time-consuming and expensive.
The proposed project leverages Logistic Regression and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to develop an efficient, data-driven model for PCOS detection. The objective is to automate diagnosis based on clinical data, reducing subjectivity and enhancing accuracy.
